Notes:

1- the experiments were on commidity machines.....
   .20 and 22 of the 145 lab.

2- settings experiment1:
   	+the scaling factor was used is 17... so that the working set exceeds the physical memory.
   		was an extension of adding... the lineitem table of the a scaling factor such that, the working 
   		set will fit in the main memory.

	+ the maximum buffer pool size was set to 6 Gs.
        + data source is the tpch.
        + query used is the query 6.

3- settings experiment2:

	+ it worked used the oltpbenchmark.
        + the scaling factor was set to 1.
        + the timing for running the experiment was 3 minutes.
